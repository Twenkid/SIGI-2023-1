I don't know the format yet, the conference might be combined: partially online, partially in person.
The details would be specified later.

Perhaps it would be free, especially if online, if we meet somewhere and we're too much we may need to rent a conference room or something or just gather somewhere else.
 
Depending on the participants it could be in either English and/or Bulgarian.

The possible dates and organization will be decided together with the prospective coorganizers and participants.

It would be great if we could arrange the meeting/seminars to be hosted by a University.
