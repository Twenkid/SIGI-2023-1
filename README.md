# Second Conference of the Society of Multidisciplinary and Interdisciplinary AGI/SIGI Researchers SIGI-2023
### SIGI - Self-Improving General Intelligence

The goal was for 2023, but I was busy and if it couldn't be organised until the end of the year it may be in early 2024 or so.

## Invitation for partners, participants and coorganizers! Покана за участници! Приглашение участников! 

See below information about the first one from 2012:

Provisional sample program and participants

* Principal Organizer: "The Sacred Computer" AGI & Transhumanism institute, Todor Arnaudov (looking for coorganizers)
* Wanted co-organizers from the fields of Robotcs, AI, ML, Aerospace, Software, ...

<b>Possible (provisional) topics:</b>

* "The Prophets of the Thinking Machine: AGI & Transhumanism: History, Theory and Pioneers" or "Todor's predictions" or <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">Theory of Universe and Mind</a>: the works of a teenage boy that were decades ahead of the current top interdisciplinary researchers and AI mainstream. A presentation of the "biblical" documentary collection book proving the pioneering work and correct predictions, probably also a presentation about the new piece from the theory which is not published yet: "Universe and Mind 6", which compares with recent talks and claims of similar recent works from the school of Karl Friston, Michael Levin, their colleagues etc.
* "Jack of All Trades" - a project for building an AGI infrastructure: summary of directions, plans (looking for partners) - see the repo and the issues: https://github.com/Twenkid/Vsy-Jack-Of-All-Trades-AGI-Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engine 
* Workshop/Tutorial: Arnoldifier - converting a deepfake library to grayscale ?
* Workshops: Review of ROS2, Gazebo, Ardupilot, Isaac ROS and Isaac SIM ... - simulation infrastructure for robotics, autonomous vehicles, flying drones ?

Daniel and Svetlin are cofounders of the AI startup "Efemarai": https://www.efemarai.com/

Orlin is a roboticist.

Georgi was a student from the world's first university course in AGI - the second version from 2011 (the first: 2010)

Todor was the author of the world's first AGI course and of the pioneering "Theory of Universe and Mind"

Alexander was a software developer with interests in transhumanism, singularity and Numenta nad Jeff Hawkins' work.

...

I don't know the format yet, the conference might be combined: partially online, partially in person.

The details would be specified later.

Perhaps it would be free, especially if online, if we meet somewhere and we're too much we may need to rent a conference room or something or just gather somewhere else.
 
Depending on the participants it could be in either English and/or Bulgarian.

The possible dates and organization will be decided together with the prospective coorganizers and participants.

It would be great if we could arrange the meeting/seminars to be hosted by a University.
